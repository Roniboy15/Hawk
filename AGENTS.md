# Engineering rules

## Scope and current setup

This is RP2040 MicroPython firmware for glider ground experiments. There is
no established flight release; the current goal is supervised table testing.

Owner-reported setup (2026-10-11):

- The glider has no engine or throttle. Older motor/throttle references are legacy.
- All servos are mounted and connected to their intended receiver channels.
- A common power rail is being ordered for the aircraft installation.

Treat these as owner-reported facts, not electrical or control-direction validation.
Mounted hardware does not automatically authorize enabling additional software axes.

## Working boundaries

Keep changes small and preserve the separation of pure mathematics, hardware
adapters and application orchestration. Describe coordinates, signs and units.
Keep pins, gains and limits in `firmware/config.py`.

Default validation is host-only. Hardware access, uploads, flashing, calibration,
actuator operation and flight tests require explicit task authorization.
Preserve device calibration; never silently overwrite it during source deployment.

## Safety contracts

- `AUTO_START=False` and `START_MODE='sensor'` are the safe defaults.
- SENSOR produces no PWM. First output requires valid RC calibration and fresh
  neutral frames; stabilization additionally requires a valid level reference.
- RX loss commands configured trim-neutral after output activation and clears
  the neutral gate. Reacquisition requires fresh neutral frames.
- Detected timing loss discards buffered RC, neutralizes active outputs and
  requires fresh neutral frames before software fallback can resume.
- Automation faults latch. Manual fallback depends on a functioning MCU and
  valid receiver input; it is not an independent recovery route.
- Final servo pulses remain bounded after trim. Integral anti-windup must account
  for those final bounds when integral control is enabled.
- The running control loop performs no flash writes.

Resolve the documented pitch-sign inconsistency before enabling pitch stabilization.
Do not infer sensor identity, signal freshness, timing guarantees or flight readiness
from host tests, register readback or WHO_AM_I alone.
An independent recovery strategy is required before considering flight operation.

## Validation and reporting

Run host tests without creating bytecode:

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

For control, timing or safety changes, add meaningful failure-path regression tests
and update the relevant architecture/validation/operator documentation.
Check MicroPython compatibility; host mocks do not validate PIO, PWM, I2C or timing.
Report changed behavior, checks performed, remaining assumptions and which hardware
measurements must be repeated. Keep verified evidence separate from inference.
